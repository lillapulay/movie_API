## About
Movie app consisting of a database containing a few movies and a client-side providing several features for users.  
This project was part of the CF Full-Stack Web Development course. 

The web application provides users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. 
Users can sign up, log in, update their account information and manage a list of their favorite movies.
