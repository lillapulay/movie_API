# movie_API (myFlix)

## About
Movie app consisting of a database containing a few movies and a client-side providing several features for users.  
This project was part of the CF Full-Stack Web Development course. 

The web application provides users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. 
Users can sign up, log in, update their account information and manage a list of their favorite movies.

## Planned updates:
#### Back-end:
- improved server-side validation 
  (username and password requirements (length, characters) and corresponding alerts/messages, 
  1 user / email, user data updates: matching params only)
  
#### Client-side:
- animated logo/title in login and registration view
- login error messages/alerts
- sort movies function
- DirectorView and GenreView updates 
  (responsive design, 'Back' button to return the previously viewed movie, display corresponding movies)
- confirmation alert for account deletion
- design updates
